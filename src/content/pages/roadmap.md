#### SDS

> Status: Released v0.0.1

[SDS](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/main/packages/p-hintjens/SDS.md) is a  library to write modular and scalable apps. It aimed to build apps fast

- Include additional linting plugins

#### Reflect

> Status: Released v.0.01, in development towards v.1.0.0

[Reflect](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/tree/main/packages/reflect) is a NodeJS package that creates ontological data of your website. In basic words, the ontological data is interrelated JSON reflecting website's files structure and code.
Reflect strives for RESTful website operations. Its goal is to transform browser-based developer tools into a coding environment, particularly powerful if combined with AI agents.

###### Use case
- Enable admin panels to edit the websites directly on browser.
- Generate UI components right on your browser using AI agents (e.g. to add advanced CSS for animation)
- Look at the website's models in the developer tools.

###### Implementations
- Typescript module implementation `@ara-web/reflect`.

- If you want to hire freelancers, then instead the rating, we use a token deposit mechanism to avoid malicious freelancers from adversary behaviour.

#### Implemented
- Lungta &ndash; a development model that includes from ideation to project release.

#### Ara Network
A blockchain based payment network that runs on the [Hyperpayment protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3TgpcZGwnmzO3SXthvqX_hG5cji6Yj3oZUMvrwDm08/edit?usp=sharing).
It tracks all software's SBOM (Software bills of materials) and distributes fees to all open-source contributors.

##### Implemented
