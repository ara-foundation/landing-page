## A blockchain that I want
Think of the blockchain as a decentralized super computer managed by the entire world.
The browser in your computer is the interface of the decentralized machine. This hypethetical browser allows to search for all software installed on the blockchain and install, manage it from your client. The blockchain that I'm going to build will provide this client.

Like on your modern smartphones, you have the App Stores, the PCs, have the Marketplaces and distributers, and the successful programming languages have the package registries.

And no blockchain has it yet. Think about a blockchain browser that is the blend of the [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/), [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and [Brave browser](https://brave.com/). The blockchain as the platform must have it as well, as the history proved this is whats necessary for the successful blockchain if you want to make it as "Web3".

The reason why no blockchain hasn't implemented it is primarily a captitalistic motivation, but not technical.

The creators of the blockchains are fixing the issues that previous blockchains had. And primarily focus on blockchain's technical novelty, hoping that all other necessary tools will be provided by the developers. Including a better tools such as wallets, dapps and other necessary things around the blockchains.

Modern blockchains are like lended shovels, even not selling it as you don't own them, but lending it. And they hope some other developers will do the heavy work such as digging the mountain to find a gold, in the web3 this gold is called a "killer dapp".

Let's say, I invented a real use-case for the blockchain technology by creating the "next Google". This is so popular app, that annually it has about 20 billion dollar worth transactions. My friend, a bitcoin maximalist argues to use the Bitcoin as its payment. Which I will never do.

Because, due to my app, there is atleast a twenty billion worth demand for the bitcoin, which makes all early keepers of it richer. As I improve my app, putting blood and sweat, increasing the market share to 200 billion, there is at-least a 200 billion worth demand for the bitcoin as well. Again, those who keep it are also winning from my work. But what they gave to me to share my efforts with them? Nothing!

This also includes the platform creators, if I will make my app as the smartcontract on Ethereum, and that smartcontract becomes popular to the point of 200 billion dollars, then early adopters will be rich, besides all others who kept the ETH coin.

So, instead as your app gets popular, I highly recommend to create its own blockchain network.

My blockchain will stand out because it will provide a client and an app store. And instead using the native coins to pay for fees, it will use the stable coins for the transactions.
