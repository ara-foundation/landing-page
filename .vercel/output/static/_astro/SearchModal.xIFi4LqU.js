I am refactoring my typescript library. I wanted to describe my journey on how I used `Rest` library to write elegant solution. I\'m so excited that I wanted to share with others my solution, hoping it would help you as well. \\n`Rest` library that I want integrate allows to create RESTFul api for any JSON by the CSS Selectors as a querying language.\\n\\nIf you have a large object or deeply nested JSON. CSS Selectors allows a powerful filtering operation to find right element at right nesting. But it\'s not about the library, but how it became elegant and saved me headaches in a long run.\\n\\nFirstly, to give a context, let me describe a library that I am refactoring. A little bit about how the library works internally. I will explain the part used in this refactoring journey. Stay with me till the end, and I hope you will also appreciate by my choice of Rest as the elegant solution. And if you will be in the same situation as I am, hopefully Rest could help you as well. :)\\n\\n> Rest module is open source and released already. It\'s available in the `@ara-web/sds` package in [npmjs](npmjs.com).\\n\\n## Refactoring\\nThe library that I am refactoring is called Reflect package. *Not released yet*. If you are a frontend developer, then with Reflect, you could change data or UI right in your browser console instead opening up the the code editor. \\n\\n> I created it, after getting tired by adjusting CSS. Also, if I had to change the text on the page, I had to go to my code editor, type `\\"Lorum ipsum.Nospace after dot\\"` to find the file. And all of it just to fix the typo. Reflect is the CMS, and Admin panel without being CMS and Admin panel, but only is a Nodejs package that works with any framework.\\n\\nHow it is working internally? Reflect creates Ontological data of the files. Ontological data is stored in the JSON format. Ontology simply means the files will be linked internally.\\n\\nReflect also supports the dynamic data. For example, if a web component parameter depends on a data fetched from the database. Reflect will fetch content from the database. Then, add the result into the JSON representation of the web component.\\n\\nThe dynamic data of the website are called `CodePiece`.\\nCode pieces are component scripts. For example, if a web component depends on variable `var userName = db.getUserId(session)`, then Code Piece will be the result of database request assigned to the user name.\\n\\nCode pieces are used internally, and results are in the `Reflect` memory: [CodePieceMemory](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/aab7c4c744ed6748e3ca5942820cdf259d81d090/packages/reflect/src/code-piece-memory.ts#L10) memory.\\n\\nReflect Memory keeps key-value pair of the code pieces and their identifiers. Key-Value pairs are defined in [CodePieceRecord](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/aab7c4c744ed6748e3ca5942820cdf259d81d090/packages/reflect/src/code-level/code-piece.ts#L22) type.\\n\\nAs code pieces also have the types. Type might be a variable\\ndeclaration, a function call, a class or a type definition etc. The potential types of code pieces is defined in [CodePieceType](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/aab7c4c744ed6748e3ca5942820cdf259d81d090/packages/reflect/src/code-level/code-piece.ts#L6) enum.\\n\\nBut interaction with this key-value memory isn\'t flexible.\\nIf we want to receive a code by the code piece type, or do \\nthey have certain attribute, then generating additional\\ninterface adds more code lines.\\n\\nLuckily, creating `Rest` module for collaboration website, I found that using it for memory is also useful.\\nIf I will need a result from memory, I could use `CodePieceMemory.get`, `CodePieceMemory.post` and other rest operations. And filtering is done by the Rest.\\n\\n## What do I need to do to use Rest in my code?\\n\\nRest doesn\'t work with JSON straight away. Rest works with the ontological object tree. So, we need to define ontological object node, and tree builder that can convert our JSON into ontological nodes.\\n\\nOntological means, instead IDs, we use links. \\nIf I say, this is ontological array, then array may be, elements of array, or size of array may be linked to another data within the project. That to understand the array, you need to find elements by the link. Basically, ontological array defines what it presents. Your source codes don\'t need it, as they have module importing rules provided by the package managers.\\nDatabases also don\'t need it, since they have `foreign-keys`.\\nBut if we want to have inter-related JSON that is agnostic of database, or file system which means we can share it, we can use it in anywhere. Then, we need it.\\n\\nSo, we the first step is to design the ontology of our code piece. Which means the links. To make it work with CSS Selectors, our links should be extending Object Links. \\n\\n> 1 First step in using Rest API for any JSON:\\n> **Design Linking rules for objects compatible with ObjectLink**\\n\\n## 1. Ontology, code piece links as object links\\n\\nObject Links are based on CSS Selectors. It\'s compatible with the CSS, so, any CSS Parser would understand object links as well.\\n\\n**Valid Object Links**\\n```css\\ndiv#main-content        /* main-content element in the page */\\na[href=\\"google.com\\"]    /* all links to google.com          */\\n.btn-primary            /* all primary buttons              */\\n```\\n\\nObject Links provide four ways to build selectors:\\n- ID\\n- Tag\\n- Class\\n- Attribute\\n\\nWe need to think, how do we design our JSON links, to match our data to object link\'s four selectors.\\n\\n### 1.1 Defining link selectors to our JSON object.\\nIn Reflect, Code pieces are already stored using identifiers. So, we will match it with id selector. \\nIf we have a variable `let userName`; Then we could\\nfetch it using `#userName` link.\\n\\nCode Pieces have its own attributes such as `public`, `data`,\\n`dataType` etc. If we want to fetch all `const varName` variables, then we could fetch using `[constant]`,\\nif we want to fetch all `let varName`, then we could write `[constant!=true]`.\\n\\nOur code pieces have a type. Let them be the tag of code piece. To return all variable declarations we could write `var`, to return all type declarations we could write `type`.\\n\\nWhen it comes to classes, we don\'t need them.\\n\\n### 1.2 Writing the code for Object Link creation\\nSo let\'s create Object Node builder four our code pieces. What will be the Rest operations work with? With the code pieces in a single memory. So, each module have it\'s own object tree from code pieces.\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { OkResult } from \\"@ara-web/p-hintjens\\";\\nimport { type ObjectToNodeTree, type ElementOp, ObjectNode, DOCUMENT_SELECTOR } from \\"@ara-web/sds\\";\\n\\nexport const moduleToObjectTree: ObjectToNodeTree<CodePiece> = (): ObjectNode<CodePiece> => {\\n    // Creating the root for entire source code that has one or many code pieces.\\n    const doc = new ObjectNode<CodePiece>(codePieceOps);\\n    return doc;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `codePieceOps` is the helpful translators, that in request by Object Node, will return respectful CSS Selector.\\n\\nHere is the declaration:\\n\\n```typescript\\nexport const codePieceOps: ElementOp<CodePiece> = {\\n\\tgetName: getCodePieceName,\\n\\tgetChildren: getCodePieceChildren,\\n\\tgetAttribute: getCodePieceAttribute,\\n\\tsetAttribute: setCodePieceAttribute,\\n}\\n```\\n\\nCode Piece Operations define four functions that CSS Selectors use for every object node.\\nBefore starting to write code pieces, we already designed how we will define the css selectors.\\n\\nWe could solve if one condition.\\n\\nThe element operator that returns ID selector of the `CodePiece`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst getCodePieceName = (_element?: CodePiece): string => {\\n\\tif (_element === undefined) {\\n\\t\\treturn DOCUMENT_SELECTOR;\\n\\t}\\n    return _element.identifier!;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd other code piece operations:\\n```typescript\\nconst getCodePieceChildren = (el: CodePiece): CodePiece[] => {\\n\\treturn el.getAllMemoryData();\\n}\\n\\nconst getCodePieceAttribute = (_element: CodePiece | undefined, attrName: string): string | undefined => {\\n\\tif (_element === undefined) {\\n\\t\\treturn undefined;\\n\\t}\\n    if (attrName in _element) {\\n        return (_element as any)[attrName]?.toString();\\n\\n    }\\n\\treturn undefined;\\n}\\n\\nconst setCodePieceAttribute = <AttrType>(_element: CodePiece | undefined, attrName: string, attrValue: AttrType): OkResult => {\\n\\tif (_element === undefined) {\\n\\t\\treturn OkResult.ok();\\n\\t}\\n\\tif (attrName in _element) {\\n\\t\\t(_element as any)[attrName] = attrValue;\\n\\t\\treturn OkResult.ok();\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\treturn OkResult.fail(`The ${_element.identifier} has no attributes`, `Can not set ${attrName} to non attributal element`)\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nVoila. Our `code-piece-object-tree.ts` is ready, how do we set the CodePieceTree?\\nSo, how do we use it and replace our previous code?\\n\\n### 1.3 Updating code to use REST\\nLet me check who is depending on the `CodePieceMemory`. What I did\\nis basically removed the code piece and turned it into a REST node\\nbased on `CodePiece`.\\n\\n> Offtopic:\\n> Luckily, I also follow the SDS rule, which makes CodePieceMemory local file and doesn\'t have to worry that removing it will break entire code.\\n\\nThe CodePieceMemory is part of `ModuleMemory` that along with code pieces keeps\\nit\'s source code, file path, and other attributes.\\n\\nWhat we need to do now is to update `ModuleMemory` to remove CodePiece and use the REST.\\n\\n---\\n> 1 day later\\n---\\n\\nI did replace `class ModuleMemory<T> extends CodePieceMemory`\\nwith the simple `ModuleMemory<T>` with the `rest()` method returning `Rest<CodePiece>`.\\n\\nNow, I can simply fetch data from module memory using `memory.rest.get!(\'#varName\') to fetch the result of the variable.\\n\\nCheck out the test files on [GitHub](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/27216bc54fa2cdd8764051d6da720cba30c79b4e/packages/reflect/test/type-declaration.test.ts#L37)."},{"group":"blog","slug":"blog/turning-reflect-into-restful-api-with-sds-package","frontmatter":{"title":"Composing rest with other rest","meta_title":"","description":"A blog describes our refactoring journey when we turned our rest to be REST operational","date":"2025-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["rest","sds","reflect","refactoring"],"author":"Medet Ahmetson","tags":["refactoring","reflect","exciting"],"draft":false},"content":"\\n# Intro\\nCurrently, there was only way to work with the [Reflect](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/tree/main/packages/reflect) package:\\n\\n```typescript\\nmodules = await reflect.get(\'node_modules\');\\n```\\n\\nReflect doesn\'t have other get options. It doesn\'t have any other operation to update the data.\\n\\nToday\'s blog is about my journey how I implemented the advanced data manipulation [SDSRest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ara-web/sds). Instead, creating each manipulation method, I turned the Reflected ontology JSON into a `SDSRest` file format. The result? I can use CSS Selectors for the Reflect:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// get all node modules\\nreflect.getAll!(\'.node_modules\')\\n// find `type URL {}` in the website scripts\\nreflect.getAll!(\'type#URL\') \\n// update the `let varName = \'\'` value if its occurs in the first file.\\nreflect.put!(\'memop > module:nth-child(1) > var#navName\', json)\\n// set actionButton as disabled.\\nreflect.patch!(\'#actionButton[disabled]\', true)\\n```\\n\\nThe `Rest` is a module that creates a RESTFul wrapper for any JSON object. And allows to use CSS Selectors for querying the JSON objects.\\nIf you have to manipulate JSON with the deeply nested objects, or without knowing exact structure, then REST might be helpful. And tell me did this blog post also helped you to understand is it worth to use SDSRest?\\n\\nEarlier I already wrote my journey in the [How did I create a REST api for any JSON object](https://www.ara.foundation/blog/turning-code-piece-into-restful-api-with-sds-package)  article. I opened it on a browser, and follow it as a guide as my own documentation.\\n\\n> I highly recommend to read the first article as here I will simply describe my throught processes without explaining what is REST and how to think in REST way.\\n\\nLet\'s start from the steps to apply Rest API for our JSON.\\n\\n# Creating ontology\\nBefore coding, I have to design the ontological structure that Rest package requires.\\nIn order to do that, I have to read the code and build a mental model of the Reflect, what will be in the REST and what\'s not.\\n\\nQuite often, trying to read the code to have a compherensive architectural view is the hardest thing. So hard, that in the past, I would procrastinate. God damn, so hard to return back to the code you wrote few months ago and try to understand it.\\n\\nI did it. So here is the plan. Reflect rest wrapper will be to all reflected website. Ontologically, each reflect\'s will be tagged as `memop`.\\n\\n> memop = extension\\n\\nEach file will be tagged as `module`.\\nAnd if the rest selector accesses to the Code Piece tags, then rest it will work with the code pieces.\\n\\nWhich means, if I will use the code peace object tags such as `var`, `class`, `type` then Rest understands we are asking code pieces.\\nIf we are using `memop` then reflect should understand we are asking to return the extension.\\nIf we are using `module` then reflect should understand we are asking to find a file.\\n\\nPlanning and writing yourself the architecture before coding also gives you a task list and their priorities. After all, knowing the architecture also allows to indetify the dependencies between the tasks.\\n\\nLet\'s code!\\n\\nPassed four hours\\n---\\n\\n## Reflect Object Tree\\nRest doesn\'t work with the JSON directly, instead it needs an intermediary data type that Rest operates with. This intermediary data type converts the JSON object into a parent-child related graph tree.\\n\\nWe don\'t create the object tree, instead create two methods that we pass to our Rest along with the JSON, and let the JSON to convert the data when its needed.\\n\\nThose two methods are \\n`ObjectToNodeTree`, `ElementOps` provided by `@ara-web/sds` package.\\n\\nThe defined reflect object is in `packages/src/reflect-object-tree.ts`.\\n\\nAnother three hours passed\\n---\\n\\n## CSS Selector for Reflect\\nCreating a CSS Selector for the modules and module operators took me less few hours. The code itself took about twenty minutes, and most of the time I had to deal by updating the test files.\\n\\nNext step is to integrate code pieces into the Reflect\'s rest, so that using `Reflect.rest.get(\'content selector\')` I could fetch data from the reflect file content.\\n\\nOne day passed\\n---\\nBut adding the Code Pieces (a.k.a file contents) took me few days, eventually discovering\\nover-engineered parts of Rest. The bug that didn\'t allow me to merge various rests together was hard to debug due to over-engineering. Eventually, updated the Rest as [@ara-web/sds@0.1.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ara-web/sds/v/0.1.3).\\n\\nAfter fixing the Object Tree Node creation, the Reflect\'s modules worked automatically.\\n\\nI created the [reflect-object-tree](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/reflect-object-tree.ts) which is creating the object tree from the reflected data.\\n\\nThe method `reflectElementToObjectTree` converts any reflected element (CodePiece, Module, Module Operator) into an\\nObject Node. \\n\\n> [Source Code on Github](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/fa1130f5cde820ad3a7d11081d6efa0c531d87ec/packages/reflect/src/reflect-object-tree.ts#L29)\\n\\nThe method `reflectElementOps` is a collection of methods that returns Object Node parameter for any JSON nodes, such as what is the id, tag, or its children.\\n\\n> [Source Code on Github](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/fa1130f5cde820ad3a7d11081d6efa0c531d87ec/packages/reflect/src/reflect-object-tree.ts#L166)\\n\\nThree days passed\\n---\\n\\n## Replace Reflect.get with Reflect.rest\\nOnce we had the reflect rest api, it\'s time to replace the \\nReflect `get` method with the `Reflect.rest`.\\n\\nBut Reflect is plug-and-play module. Reflect\'s `get` method calls the extension hooks such as `beforeGet` and `afterGet` (source on [github](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/fa1130f5cde820ad3a7d11081d6efa0c531d87ec/packages/reflect/src/extension-interface.ts#L106)).\\n\\nLuckily, Rest module also implemented in SDS framework. So instead directly using Rest in Reflect, let\'s simply create a Rest Proxy that will call the Reflect hooks.\\n\\nWhat we will do is, we will create `RestReflectHookProxy`.\\nAdditionally, we will add all other rest related hooks before and after calling the rest operators.\\n\\nIt took more time, as I found out a bug in object duplication.\\nSimply I had to duplicate the object copy using `Object.create(obj)` instead using spread operator `{...obj, ...obj.hidedMethods}\\n\\nAnother time took to test that rest proxies are working properly.\\n\\nPassed the three days. \\nIt\'s done, and tests are working [Test](https://github.com/ara-foundation/web/blob/f3d2424b5040caf8ec9191cf2d30d65c73fc2a1c/packages/reflect/test/6-reflect.test.ts#L37) files to see how it\'s implemented.\\n\\nToday\\n---\\n\\nBefore releasing it, finally I upgraded the reflect extensions\\nto know what methods to export and what not. After seeing that reflect works correctly, I pushed the code to the github.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n- Reflect Astro Extension\'s rest operator must include Astro\'s `page`, `component` and other astro website contents.\\n- Add a rest extension that writes back the updated ontology into the file or database data.\\n\\nThen, reflect is ready to be used as a toolbar and an AI assistant.
